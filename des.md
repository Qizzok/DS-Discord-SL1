## DeS - SL1 Requirements

For SL1 Slayer we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:

* All Bosses - Empty arena / Souls

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 No Rolling/Blocking/Parrying
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Toxic, No Poison
- SL1 Fist only
- SL1 Broken Weapon
- SL1 Blindfolded
  - Not allowed to see the screen, you need a clear webcam stream to prove. 
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 No Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.


## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

* Morion Blade. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Clever Rat Ring on base NG. It's too strong.
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Biorr of the Twin Fangs against Penetrator. Just don't unlock his cell in 1-2.
* Thief Ring against flamelurker, old hero, storm king, and dragon god.
* Offensive spells/miracles (which you can hardly cast). 
* Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
