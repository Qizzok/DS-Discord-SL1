# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Demon's Souls](./des.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
_Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ are both allowed and have the same requirements.

**Please remember to check necessary global requirements (e.g. recording for a legend run). Read the Index page.**

## DS1 & DS1:R - SL1 Requirements

**For SL1 Champion we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**

* Stray Demon - Empty arena
* Taurus Demon - Empty arena
* Bell Gargoyles - Empty arena
* Capra Demon - Key to the Depths / Empty Arena
* Gaping Dragon - Key to Blighttown / Empty arena
* Demon Firesage - Demon's Catalyst / Empty arena
* Centipede Demon - Empty arena
* Black Dragon Kalameet - Calamity Ring / Empty arena
* All Boss Souls and/or their empty arenas

**As long as the run allows it, cheesing Bed of Chaos and Ceaseless Discharge is fine.**

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


## DS1 & DS1:R - SL1 Resources

Generally, Reinforced Club is your main weapon for most if not all the game. Eventually it is recommended to upgrade it to a Chaos Reinforced Club -and possibly a Lightning Reinforced Club if you don't want to or can't use Blacksmith Giant Hammer-. Using fire damage for early game and then upgrade to Chaos is fine. Mentioned before, Blacksmtih Giant Hammer is the other most recommended weapon, so alternating between them based on boss resistances is optimal.

  - Record the full run.
  - Duke Skip is not mandatory. Your death to Seath's first encounter won't be counted.

## SL1 Legend Banned Equipment

* Red Tear Stone Ring. It's too strong. Allowed only for combined runs at NG+6, e.g. NG+6 no roll.
* Offensive Pyromancy spells. Power Within, Great Combustion, Black Flame, Fireorb and Great Chaos Fireball are all too strong.
* Dragon Torso Stone fist weapon. Overpowered for low damage runs, pointless for other challenges.
* Silver Pendant. Not needed and trivializes one of the harder bosses
* Poise tanking. Fights do not need to be flawless but you can't be relying on poise and armor to survive rather than dodging. To some extent this is at checkers' discretion.
* Damaging consumables are not allowed on any low damage run.
