**Please remember to check necessary global requirements (e.g. recording for a legend run). Read the Index page.**

## BB - BL4 Requirements

**For BL4 Good Hunter we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**

* Every Boss lamp
* Stats
* Video of Moon Presence kill / Screenshot of your player character waking up in the Clinic (NG+) with 230k blood echoes.
  - It is recommendable, because of this, to start the final fight with 0 blood echoes (preventing problems in the remote case you are able to one-shot it all).
