# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines.

 * [Demon's Souls](./des.md)
 * [Dark Souls or Dark Souls: Remastered](./ds1.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.html).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
_Dark Souls: Remastered_ and _Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin_ have the same requirements as _Dark Souls_ and _Dark Souls II_. All are allowed.

### Banned Criteria

- Any kind of help via summoning players or NPCs is not acceptable. The run will be disqualified because of this. This rule doesn't mean you can't do Sirris' or Anri's quest since you are summoned into their world for their quests (these are not your bossfights, so they don't count). This is also the case for Biorr of the Twin Fangs vs the Penetrator.

- Unless required by the criteria for a run, it is not allowed to obtain items before it is usually possible. For example, giving yourself a boss weapon as soon as you start a normal SL1/BL4 run is unacceptable and will result in a disqualification.
   - Exceptions: 
     - Ask the server mods for discussion and/or permission if there is the possibility of such.
     - Normally it is acceptable to use Cheat Engine to give yourself items required for a Legend run. For example, giving yourself a torch as soon as you start the game to complete a Torch-only run.

- Cheating and cheesing during gameplay is strictly not allowed. Turning on iframes, tumblebuffing, kills outside the bosses' arenas, messing with the stats, breaking the AI so it becomes unable to harm you... Any of this, or anything similar, will result in a disqualification. Please ask if you are uncertain about what is allowed and what isn't.

### Proof for SL1 Champion of Dark Souls I, II or III | SL1 Slayer of Demon's Souls | BL4 Good Hunter of Bloodborne

**You need to beat all boss fights -including DLCs- then show proof.**

You have **two** choices in order to show proof:

* Record a video of you showing your character stats and all boss souls/bonfires/empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them.

* Make a gallery of **full** screenshots (no cropping or editing will be allowed) of your character stats, all boss souls, and bonfires/empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them. See the page for the game you are playing for specific requirements as this varies by game.

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


### Proof for SL1 Legend of Dark Souls I, II or III | SL1 Monumental of Demon's Souls | BL4 Great One of Bloodborne
> Legends runs are SL1 runs with one or more handicaps to make it harder. Check the games' pages for a list of what counts, and what doesn't. If you have any doubt, ask the server mods.

To prove and verify this challenge, you need to beat and record/stream all boss fights -including DLCs*- no matter what. It is also recommended to start recordings before you enter the boss fog. A recording where the fight is ongoing and the boss has lost significant health or has advanced through phases will not be accepted, and consequently disqualified.

If you are streaming or recording an entire run (start to finish), please provide timestamps as the mods are expecting to check boss kills. Not taking the time to do so will just cause the verification to have a longer wait.

|* _Unless you are going for a run with the typical 'Any%' rule set. This is only applicable to speedrunning._

### Speediest Roles

You can obtain a special role if you are the fastest player in the server to complete a SL1 or BL4 run in any of the games -all bosses-. However, if someone beats your time, you will lose the role.

| _Demon's Souls_ | Unsafekibble716 (unsafekibble716#1208) | [2:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iziZoq3-cFs)  |
| _Dark Souls I_ | Evoryn (Evoryn#4281) | [3:48:37](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/284101512) - Remastered  |
| _Dark Souls II_ | N/A | N/A |
| _Dark Souls III_ | Decc (decc#0001) | [1:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpZPqGeFn48) |
| _Bloodborne_ | N/A | N/A |

Since there is not a time set for DS2 or BB, any time quicker than 4:00:00 for BB will count. For DS2, any time quicker than 7:00:00 will count.

Decc did his speedrun prior to the Ringed City DLC. The role is up for grabs for the first person to do all bosses including the aforementioned DLC in less than 2:10:00.
